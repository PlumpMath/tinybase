**Documentation for the System Management (SM) component**


Main Idea
---------
//TODO A completer


tinybase, dbcreate and dbdestroy utilities
------------------------------------------
The three utilities are used to set up the databases (creating folder, catalog
tables, etc.).

**dbcreate**
//TODO expliquer comment marche le programme

**tinybase**
//TODO expliquer comment marche le programme

**dbdestroy**
//TODO expliquer comment marche le programme

**sm_manager**

 + Help()
 In this method, the sm_manager prints the list of the relations in the existing base. Therefore, the sm_manager's 
 method Help() is supposed to enter the relcat catalog. After opening the files, it goes through the lines thanks to
 a FileScan instance and reads the first entry of the tables' line.
 Then, it prints the name of the relation thanks to the Printer Class (we have to create an instance of it in the
 method) and its print() method.
 
 + Help(const char* relname)
 In this method, we are given the name of a table or relation. We have to print the attributes of this relation.
 Therefore, we use the attrcat catalog to find them. In fact, the attrcat catalog owns each relation attributes.
 We scan the catalog with an option to find exactly the relation matching the given relname.
 Then, we instanciate a Printer for the attributes, and print them.
 
 + Print(const char* relname)
 There, we are given a relname and we are supposed to print all the tuples of this relation. We create a table of
 DataAttrInfo. This table we fill with a FileScan going through the tuples. Then, we instanciate a Printer and this 
 Printer prints the tuples by going through the DataAttrInfo table.
